# Data Cleaning SQL Project - README
## Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing a dataset named "Nashville Housing" using SQL queries. The dataset contains information about housing properties in Nashville, including various attributes. The goal of this project is to perform data cleaning tasks to ensure data quality and consistency, enabling further analysis and modeling.

## Dataset Description
The "Nashville Housing" dataset consists of a single table. It contains information about housing properties in Nashville, including details such as address, price, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, total area in square feet, year built, parking spaces available, and whether the property has a pool.

## Project Steps
### Step 1: Connect to the Database
Establish a database connection to the "Nashville Housing" dataset.
Ensure appropriate permissions for creating tables, modifying data, and executing queries.
### Step 2: Data Exploration
Explore the dataset's structure and contents.
Identify missing or inconsistent values.
Understand the data types of each column.
### Step 3: Data Cleaning
Handle missing or null values effectively (e.g., imputation, deletion).
Standardize inconsistent data (e.g., casing, formatting).
Remove duplicate records.
Validate and clean data in each column to ensure quality.
Address any other data quality issues discovered during exploration.
### Step 4: Data Transformation
Perform necessary data transformations, such as type conversions or derived column creation.
Ensure the data is in a suitable format for further analysis.
### Step 5: Data Validation
Validate the cleaned dataset to meet desired criteria.
Verify data adherence to defined business rules or constraints.
Conduct integrity checks to identify remaining anomalies or inconsistencies.
### Step 6: Documentation
Document the data cleaning steps taken, including assumptions and decisions made.
Capture data quality insights or limitations affecting future analysis.
## Conclusion
Through the outlined steps, the "Nashville Housing" dataset will be cleaned and prepared for further analysis. The resulting clean dataset will facilitate accurate insights, modeling, and decision-making related to Nashville housing.

Ensure documenting SQL queries, cleaning steps, and gained insights for future reference and reproducibility.
